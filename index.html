        <h1 class="page-title">Kyudo</h1>
        <p>
          Kyudo, the way of the Bow, is one of the ancient martial arts of
          Japan. Kyudo is not merely shooting an arrow at a target. It is a way
          of life, a journey, a journey of pursuing the truth, the goodness and
          the beauty in life. Unlike western archery, this is not a competitive
          sport against others. The competition is with one’s inner self to
          harness the mind and to master the technique.
        </p>

        <h2>Why do Kyudo?</h2>
        <p>
          Kyudo is an excellent way to achieve physical, mental and spiritual
          well-being. It helps to improve mind-body coordination, posture,
          balance, muscle tone and general physical fitness. Even more
          importantly, it gives you a sense of joy and a feeling of
          accomplishment. It shows you the way to mindfulness. Kyudo is one of
          the most prestigious and respected martial art forms in Japan and
          around the world, practiced by many as a method of physical, moral and
          spiritual development.
        </p>

        <h2>How will I be taught?</h2>
        <p>
          The atmosphere in the dojo is one of friendship, togetherness and
          mutual respect. We have students from all walks of life, male and
          female. Some have been practicing Kyudo with us for more than 10
          years, others are only just starting. Our ways are informal.
          Traditional courtesies, etiquette and cultural values are respected
          and encouraged.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I start practicing Kyudo?</h2>
