        <p>
          The New Zealand Kyudo Federation (NZKF) promotes the practice and
          teaching of traditional Kyudo - the art of the Japanese bow - in New
          Zealand. The organisation represents New Zealand’s national charter in
          the

          >and the
          <a

          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          The NZKF is the governing body for ANKF kyudo in New Zealand, and aims
          to assist local groups in developing kyudo in both North and South
          Islands. The NZKF organises annual seminars for its members, usually
          held in Auckland. Our members also take part in international seminars
          held in Japan, and may take examinations for dan-ranking (issued by
          the All Nippon Kyudo Federation).
        </p>
        <p>
          The NZKF is a non-profit voluntary organisation, governed by an
          elected committee. The practice of kyudo is supervised by a technical
          committee, composed of those members with the highest grading and
          experience in kyudo. Clubs (dojo) in New Zealand are established and
          given recognition by the NZKF and are under its supervision. Each dojo
          leader should be a graded person with appropriate experience to teach
          kyudo safely.

        <h2 id="kyudo">Kyudo</h2>
        <p>
          Kyudo, the way of the Bow, is one of the ancient martial arts of
          Japan. Kyudo is not merely shooting an arrow at a target. It is a way
          of life, a journey, a journey of pursuing the truth, the goodness and
          the beauty in life. Unlike western archery, this is not a competitive
          sport against others. The competition is with one’s inner self to
          harness the mind and to master the technique.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do Kyudo?</h3>
        <p>
          Kyudo is an excellent way to achieve physical, mental and spiritual
          well-being. It helps to improve mind-body coordination, posture,
          balance, muscle tone and general physical fitness. Even more
          importantly, it gives you a sense of joy and a feeling of
          accomplishment. It shows you the way to mindfulness. Kyudo is one of
          the most prestigious and respected martial art forms in Japan and
          around the world, practiced by many as a method of physical, moral and
          spiritual development.
        </p>

        <h3>How will I be taught?</h3>
        <p>
          The atmosphere in the dojo is one of friendship, togetherness and
          mutual respect. We have students from all walks of life, male and
          female. Some have been practicing Kyudo with us for more than 10
          years, others are only just starting. Our ways are informal.
          Traditional courtesies, etiquette and cultural values are respected
          and encouraged.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I start practicing Kyudo?</h3>
        <p>
          Please find a local club in your area blow to register your interest and join a session.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I become an NZKF member?</h3>
        <p>After joining a club, your club will ask you to register as an NZKF member.</p>
        <p>
          Being a New Zealand Kyudo Federation member will enable you to attend
          national and international Kyudo seminars, and take examinations. This
          is different from belonging to a local club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your local club's committee will let you know when you are ready to
