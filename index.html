      <h2 id="about">About NZKF</h2>
      <p>The New Zealand Kyudo Federation (NZKF) promotes the practice and teaching of traditional Kyudo - the art of the Japanese bow - in New Zealand. The organisation represents New Zealand’s national charter in the <a href="http://kyudo.jp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="http://kyudo.jp">All Nippon Kyudo Federation (ANKF) </a>and the <a href="http://www.ikyf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="http://www.ikyf.org/">International Kyudo Federation (IKYF)</a>.</p>
      <p>The NZKF is the governing body for ANKF kyudo in New Zealand, and aims to assist local groups in developing kyudo in both North and South Islands. The NZKF organises annual seminars for its members, usually held in Auckland. Our members also take part in international seminars held in Japan, and may take examinations for dan-ranking (issued by the All Nippon Kyudo Federation).</p>
      <p>The NZKF is a non-profit voluntary organisation, governed by an elected committee. The practice of kyudo is supervised by a technical committee, composed of those members with the highest grading and experience in kyudo. Clubs (dojo) in New Zealand are established and given recognition by the NZKF and are under its supervision. Each dojo leader should be a graded person with appropriate experience to teach kyudo safely.</p>

    <section aria-labelledby="kyudo">
      <h2 id="kyudo">Kyudo</h2>
      <p>Kyudo, the way of the Bow, is one of the ancient martial arts of Japan. Kyudo is not merely shooting an arrow at a target. It is a way of life, a journey, a journey of pursuing the truth, the goodness and the beauty in life. Unlike western archery, this is not a competitive sport against others. The competition is with one’s inner self to harness the mind and to master the technique.</p>
      
      <h3>Why do Kyudo?</h3>
      <p>
        Kyudo is an excellent way to achieve physical, mental and spiritual well-being. It helps to improve mind-body coordination, posture, balance, muscle tone and general physical fitness. Even more importantly, it gives you a sense of joy and a feeling of accomplishment. It shows you the way to mindfulness. Kyudo is one of the most prestigious and respected martial art forms in Japan and around the world, practiced by many as a method of physical, moral and spiritual development.
      </p>

      <h3>How will I be taught?</h3>
      <p>The atmosphere in the dojo is one of friendship, togetherness and mutual respect. We have students from all walks of life, male and female. Some have been practicing Kyudo with us for more than 10 years, others are only just starting. Our ways are informal. Traditional courtesies, etiquette and cultural values are respected and encouraged.</p>
    
      <h3>How do I become an NZKF member?</h3>
      <p>Being a New Zealand Kyudo Federation member will enable you to attend national and international Kyudo seminars, and take examinations. This is different from belonging to a local club.</p>
      <p>Your club committee will be let you know when you are ready to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDhUUVYJEqbBycBc6OzLoIOPUtpTK38fdPO0a1fO-4Kq3lFA/viewform?usp=sf_link">register as an NZKF member</a>.</p>
