          The New Zealand Kyudo Federation (NZKF) promotes the practice and
          teaching of traditional Kyudo - the art of the Japanese bow - in New
          Zealand. The organisation represents New Zealand’s national charter in
          the

        <p>
          The NZKF is the governing body for ANKF kyudo in New Zealand, and aims
          to assist local groups in developing kyudo in both North and South
          Islands. The NZKF organises annual seminars for its members, usually
          held in Auckland. Our members also take part in international seminars
          held in Japan, and may take examinations for dan-ranking (issued by
          the All Nippon Kyudo Federation).
        </p>
        <p>
          The NZKF is a non-profit voluntary organisation, governed by an
          elected committee. The practice of kyudo is supervised by a technical
          committee, composed of those members with the highest grading and
          experience in kyudo. Clubs (dojo) in New Zealand are established and
          given recognition by the NZKF and are under its supervision. Each dojo
          leader should be a graded person with appropriate experience to teach
          kyudo safely.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I become an NZKF member?</h3>
        <p>
          After joining a club, your club will ask you to register as an NZKF
          member.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a New Zealand Kyudo Federation member will enable you to attend
          national and international Kyudo seminars, and take examinations. This
          is different from belonging to a local club.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your local club's committee will let you know when you are ready to
