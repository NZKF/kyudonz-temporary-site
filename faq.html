    <h2 id="faq">Auckland Kyudo Club's Frequently asked questions</h2>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>Where does the club meet for Kyudo practice?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The Auckland Kyudo Club meets for weekly practice at the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/FGsQ3X4j7Lgv8SBx6">YMCA Lagoon Stadium Leisure Centre located at 44 Domain Road in Panmure, Auckland</a>.</p>
        <p>Please note, there is also a YMCA pool facility opposite the stadium located on Lagoon Drive, however, you cannot access the stadium from Lagoon Drive.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>When and where is the practice?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Weekly practice is held from <strong>5:30 pm to 8:30 pm each Saturday</strong>. Please ensure you arrive at least 15 minutes before the scheduled start time to assist with equipment setup and ensure we can start on time.</p>
        <p>The club also usually meets once a month on a Sunday at the Waiau Pa Dojo in Kingseat for practice and equipment maintenance (bows, targets, etc.). Dates and times are confirmed and communicated at weekly practice sessions.</p>
      </dd>
      </dd>

      <dt>What should I wear for practice?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Club members wear the standard Kyudo uniform (keiko-gi, obi, hakama and tabi).</p>
        <p>If you do not own a Kyudo uniform, please wear comfortable clothing (e.g. t-shirt, sport pants and socks).</p>
      </dd>
	    
      <dt>I am joining as a dan holder. When can I join the regular practice sessions?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you have previously obtained a dan grade through the International Kyudo Federation (IKYF) or All Nippon Kyudo Federation (ANKF), then you may join our regular practice for a trial session (<strong>a one off $10 charge applies</strong>, which is expected to be paid either before or during the trial session via cash or internet banking).</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you obtained your dan through an organisation other than the IKYF or ANKF, please provide the relevant details to our Attendance Officer. The Auckland Kyudo Club committee will consider your application on a case by case basis.</p>
	<p>After completing your trial session, if you would like to continue with Kyudo practice, then you may become a member of the Auckland Kyudo Club and join us for regular practice on a monthly or concession basis (refer to answers further below for details).</p>
      </dd>
	    
      <dt>I am joining as a beginner or mudan. When can I join the regular practice sessions?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>For your own safety, and the safety of other club members, you must first complete the full beginners course before you can join the other members for regular practice.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have practised Kyudo before, but have not obtained a dan grade yet, then you are still required to join the beginners class initially, but may be able to join our regular members earlier if our President determines that it is safe for you to do so.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>What is the minimum age for joining the Auckland Kyudo Club?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You must be <strong>at least 16 years old</strong> to join the Auckland Kyudo Club. If you are under the age of 18, then you will need consent from your parent or legal guardian before you can join the Auckland Kyudo Club.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>About our beginners course.</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Each beginners class comprises <strong>a trial session (a one-off $10 harge applies)</strong>. This is expected to be paid either before or during the trial practice via cash or internet banking.</p>
	<p>If you are interested in staying with us after the trial, you will be required to join our <strong>6 week training program (a one-off $150 charge applies)</strong>, which is structured to help beginners to establish sufficient understanding of the basic form of shooting before joining regular practice.</p>
        <p>Each beginners session is approximately 90 minutes in duration. You are welcome to stay on after the end of your session to watch the taihai practice by club members.</p>
        <p>It is important to understand that Kyudo is different from Western archery with a strong focus on form and practice, rather than the actual target shooting itself. Please consider this before joining the Auckland Kyudo Club. <a href="https://www.emptymindfilms.com/movies/one-shot-one-life/">One Shot One Life documentary</a> provide an excellent overview.</p>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: You must prepay for the trial session if you would like to guarantee your space. Walk-ins on the day of the trial session will be accepted on a first come, first served basis if space is available.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>How much does joining the Auckland Kyudo Club cost?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you enjoy Kyudo, and would like to continue with Kyudo practice after you complete the beginners class, then you will be asked to pay the club’s <strong>annual membership fee of $65</strong>. This covers your registration and membership with the New Zealand Kyudo Federation (NZKF) and International Kyudo Federation (IKYF).</p>
        <p>All Auckland Kyudo Club members attending any practice sessions or seminars during the year are required to maintain a current NZKF and IKYF registration.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>How much does training as a member of the Auckland Kyudo Club cost?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>The monthly fee for attending regular practice is $75 per month due on the first working day of each month.</p>
        <p>If you are unable to attend practice regularly, then you also have the option of purchasing a concession card for $250. Each concession card is valid for ten (10) practice sessions or 6 months (whichever comes first). Concession cards are automatically extended during periods of no practice (e.g. facility closures, Christmas and New Year holidays, etc.).</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>I am unable to attend all of the beginners sessions of my chosen course. What should I do?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>If you are unable to attend all beginners sessions of your course, then, depending on your progress, you may be asked to rejoin the next beginners course to complete the required induction, so you are able to safely practise by yourself.</p>
        <p>If you are unable to attend all of the beginner sessions, it is possible to arrange a rescheduled session (<strong>for one or two sessions only</strong>), or you would be required to continue the lesson when under our regular practice. In any case, it is highly suggested that you attend all your beginners class to avoid complexity.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Do I need to purchase any equipment to join the Auckland Kyudo Club?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>No, you are free to use the club’s equipment. Though, you will be required to purchase consumables such as bow strings and giriko powder.</p>
        <p>In the long term, if you would like your own equipment, our club would occasionally do a bulk buy from Kyugu in Japan.</p>
        <p>The smallest bow owned by the club is the Namisun. You must be at least 150 cm tall with a draw length of about 75–80 cm to be able to safely use this bow.</p>
        <p>Custom size bows can be ordered from Japan, however, these are quite costly, and the club does not currently own such specialised equipment.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Can I bring my child to practise?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You may bring your child to watch Kyudo practice. However, any children under the age of 16 must be actively supervised by an adult at all times. Hence, unless another adult actively supervises your child to keep them safe at all times, you will be unable to join practice.</p>
        <p>This is a strict Health and Safety requirement. You and your child may be asked to leave the club facilities in case of any behaviour considered unsafe by senior club members.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>What other safety precautions should I be aware of?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>You must not wear any earrings, jewellery, watches or other attachments to your body that may get entangled in or catch the bow string, which can cause injury.</p>
        <p>You must at all times remain behind the shooting line during practice.</p>
        <p>You must follow the instructions of senior club members at all times (e.g. no shooting while arrows are being collected from the targets).</p>
        <p>Beginners must not shoot from positions one (1) and five (5) to avoid damage to the facility should the arrow stray during shooting.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Are there limited spaces available for beginner training?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Yes. There is a maximum of eight (8) beginners per beginner class.</p>
        <p>Spaces are allocated on a first-come first-serve basis. Your space will only be confirmed once payment of the beginners course fee has been received by the club. If all spaces for the next beginners course have already been allocated, you will be given the option to join the next available beginners course.</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Can I join part way through a beginner class once it has started?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>No, the beginner class sessions build upon the knowledge and experience gained from prior sessions. It is not possible to join a beginner class after it has started.</p>
        <p>If you missed the start of a beginners class, please register your interest for the next beginners class advertised on the NZKF website.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Payment method</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>All payment is to be made to directly to the Auckland Kyudo Club bank account:</p>
