      <h2 id="faq">Auckland Kyudo Club's Frequently asked questions</h2>
      
      <h3>I am joining as a beginner. When can I join the regular practice sessions?</h3>
      <p>For your own safety, and the safety of other club members, you must first complete the full beginners course before you can join the other members for regular practice.</p>
      
      <h3>What is the minimum age for joining the Auckland Kyudo Club? </h3>
      <p>You must be at least 16 years old to join the Auckland Kyudo Club. If you are under the age of 18, then you will need consent from your parent or legal guardian before you can join the Auckland Kyudo Club.</p>
      
      <h3>Do I need to purchase any equipment to join the Auckland Kyudo Club? </h3>
      <p>No, you are free to use the club’s equipment when you join Auckland Kyudo Club until you are more advanced and will want your own equipment. The club owns and maintains a range of Kyudo gear. The club fees cover use of the equipment.</p>
      <p>You will be asked to purchase consumables such as bow strings, giriko powder, etc. for use with the club bows and gloves.</p>
      <p>The smallest bow owned by the club is the Namisun. You must be at least 150 cm tall with a draw length of about 75–80 cm to be able to safely use this bow.</p>
      <p>The largest bow maintained by the club is the Rokusun. You must be no taller than 210 cm with a draw length of about 105-110 cm to be able to safely use this bow.</p>
      <p>Custom size bows can be ordered from Japan, however, these are quite costly, and the club does not currently own such specialised equipment.</p>
      
      <h3>I am unable to attend all of the beginners sessions of my chosen course. What should I do?</h3>
      <p>If you are unable to attend all beginners sessions of your cause, then, depending on your progress, you may be asked to join the next beginners course to complete the required induction, so you are able to safely practice by yourself.</p>
      
      <h3>What is the duration of a beginner session?</h3>
      <p>Each beginners session is 90 minutes in duration, starting at 7:00 pm and finishing at 8:30 pm.</p>
      <p>Please ensure you arrive by 6:50 pm for an on time start of the practice session.</p>
      <p>You are welcome to stay on after the end of your session to watch the regular practice by club members.</p>
      
      <h3>When and where are the regular practice sessions held?</h3>
      <p>The club's regular practices are also held each Friday in the same location. Beginners train in a separate dedicated group guided by senior club members.</p>
      <h3>How much does joining the Auckland Kyudo Club cost?</h3>
      <p>There is no joining fee for Auckland Kyudo Club, however, there is an annual fee of $65 for membership registration with the New Zealand Kyudo Federation (NZKF) and International Kyudo Federation (IKYF).</p>
      <p>This fee must be paid directly to the Auckland Kyudo Club bank account using the following details:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Auckland Kyudo Club<br /> 
          38-9014-0641547-00
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>All Auckland Kyudo Club members attending any beginner classes, practice sessions or seminars during the year are required to maintain a current NZKF and IKYF registration.</p>
      
      <h3>How much does training as a member of the Auckland Kyudo Club cost?</h3>
      <p>The fee for joining regular practice sessions is either $20 per session (casual rate) payable on the day, or $50 per month (monthly rate) if paid by automatic transfer to the Auckland Kyudo Club bank account.</p>
      <p>Monthly payment must be received by the 10th of each month, otherwise the casual rate applies.</p>
      <p>All payments must be made to the Auckland Kyudo Club bank account using the following details:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Auckland Kyudo Club<br /> 
          38-9014-0641547-00
        </strong>
      </p>
      
      <h3>How much does the beginners class cost</h3>
      <p>The fee for the beginners class is $120.</p>
      <p>This fee is payable after your first beginners session if you would like to continue with Kyudo. It covers six additional beginner training sessions to familiarise yourself with the eight steps of shooting and the philosophy of Kyudo, and to prepare you to safely practice by yourself as part of regular practice.</p>
      <p>All payments must be made to the Auckland Kyudo Club bank account using the following details:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Auckland Kyudo Club<br /> 
          38-9014-0641547-00
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>If you enjoy Kyudo, and would like to continue with Kyudo practice after you complete the beginners class, then you can join the Auckland Kyudo Club. Upon joining the club, you will be asked to pay the annual fee of $65 for registration with the New Zealand Kyudo Federation.</p>
      
      <h3>Can I try before joining the Auckland Kyudo Club to see if I like Kyudo?</h3>
      <p>Yes, the first beginner session is free of charge and you do not have to pay the joining fee.</p>
      <p>You only have to pay the $120 beginner class fee if you decide to continue</p>
      
      <h3>Can I join part way through a beginner class once it has started?</h3>
      <p>No, the beginner class sessions build upon the knowledge and experience gained from prior sessions. It is not possible to join a beginner class after it has started.</p>
      <p>If you missed the start of a beginners class, please register your interest for the next beginners class advertised on the NZKF website.</p>
      
      <h3>I would like to pay by automatic payment to always take advantage of the monthly rate. What do I need to do?</h3>
      <p>Set up an automatic payment of $50 to the Auckland Kyudo Club bank account before the 10th of the month and using your name as payment reference.</p>
      
      <h3>How often do you practice?</h3>
      <p>The club practices every Friday (except on public holidays). The club also meets once a month on a Sunday at the Waiau Pa Dojo in Kingseat for practice and equipment maintenance (bows, targets, etc.).</p>
      
      <h3>When and how long is practice?</h3>
      <p>Weekly practice is from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm each Friday. We meet at the club between 6:30 pm and 6:40 pm for setup, and leave between 9:20 and 9:30 once equipment has been stowed.</p>
      
      <h3>What should I wear for practice?</h3>
      <p>Club members wear the standard Kyudo uniform (keiko-gi, obi, hakama and tabi).</p>
      <p>If you do not own a Kyudo uniform, please wear comfortable clothing (e.g. t-shirt, sport pants and socks).</p>
      
      <h3>Can I bring my child to practice?</h3>
      <p>You may bring your child to watch Kyudo practice. However, any children under the age of 16 must be actively supervised by an adult at all times. Hence, unless another adult actively supervises your child to keep them safe at all times, you will be unable to join practice.</p>
      <p>This is a strict Health and Safety requirement. You and your child may be asked to leave the club facilities in case of any behaviour considered unsafe by senior club members.</p>
      
      <h3>What other safety precautions should I be aware of?</h3>
      <p>You must not wear any earrings, jewelry, watches or other attachments to your body that may get entangled in or catch the bow string, which can cause injury.</p>
      <p>You must at all times remain behind the shooting line during practice.</p>
      <p>You must follow the instructions of senior club members at all times (e.g. no shooting while arrows are being collected from the targets).</p>
      <p>Beginners must not shoot from positions 1 and 5 to avoid damage to the facility should the arrow stray during shooting.</p>
      
      <h3>How many beginner sessions are there?</h3>
      <p>Each beginners class comprises 7 sessions. The first session is free of charge to allow you to see if you enjoy Kyudo, and would like to commit to the 6 week program of the beginner class.</p>
      <p>The beginners class is structured to help Beginners to establish good basic form before joining regular practice. This both prevents accidents and helps faster progress once you are shooting by yourself.</p>
      <p>It is important to understand that Kyudo is different from Western archery with a strong focus on form and practice, rather than the actual target shooting itself. Please consider this before joining the Auckland Kyudo Club.</p>
      <p>We also highly recommend watching <a href="https://www.emptymindfilms.com/movies/one-shot-one-life/">Empty Mind Film's One Shot, One Life</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Are there limited spaces available for beginner training?</h3>
      <p>Yes. There is a maximum of eight (8) beginners per beginner class.</p>
      <p>Spaces are allocated on a first-come first-serve basis. If all spaces for the next beginners course have already been allocated, you will be given the option to join the next available beginners course.</p>
